**DOMAIN**: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH

# Description
This Python program implements a rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text similarity. The chatbot, named SeekDeep, can engage in conversation based on the text provided in the data.txt file. It identifies greetings, processes user queries, and responds with the most relevant sentence from the text file.

**Key Features and Technologies Used**
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
   - Tokenization (splitting text into words/sentences)
   - Lemmatization (reducing words to base form)
   - Removing punctuation for better text processing
2. TF-IDF Vectorization
   - Converts text into numerical representations
   - Finds the most relevant response using cosine similarity
3. Rule-Based Greeting Mechanism
   - Recognizes and responds to common greetings
4. Dynamic Learning
   - The chatbot dynamically adds user input to the tokenized list for improved response selection
5. User-Friendly Chat Interface
   - Provides appropriate responses and exits gracefully when the user types "bye"

**Conclusion**

This chatbot provides a basic yet effective rule-based conversational AI using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity. While it doesnâ€™t "understand" language like AI-powered models, it demonstrates fundamental text processing, similarity matching, and NLP techniques in Python.
